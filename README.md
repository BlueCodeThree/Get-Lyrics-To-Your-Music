# Get Lyrics To Your Music

## search_lyrics.py

This script asks the user to input a song title and the artist in the terminal. It then returns the lyrics for that song. 

## lyrics_currently_playing.py

This script also runs in the terminal. First the user must authenticate their Spotify account. 

Then, once you have a valid token, the script grabs the song that is currently playing, and returns the lyrics for that song. 

## top_tracks.py

Another terminal script, this prints out your top tracks and artists you've listened to on Spotify. This script asks for user input for the amount of results that you wish to see, and the time period that you would like to pull the results from (either short, medium or long term). I also added in error handling. 

### Dependancies
