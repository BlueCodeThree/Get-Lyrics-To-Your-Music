# Get Lyrics To Your Music

## search_lyrics.py

This script asks the user to input a song title and the artist in the terminal. It then returns the lyrics for that song. 

## lyrics_currently_playing.py

This script also runs in the terminal. First the user must authenticate their Spotify account. 

Then, once you have a valid token, the script grabs the song that is currently playing, and returns the lyrics for that song.
