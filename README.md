# Get Lyrics To Your Music

## search_lyrics.py

This script asks the user to input a song title and the artist in the terminal. It then returns the lyrics for that song. 

## lyrics_currently_playing.py

This script also runs in the terminal. First the user must authenticate their Spotify account. 

Then, once you have a valid token, the script grabs the song that is currently playing, and returns the lyrics for that song. 

## top_tracks.py

Another terminal script, this prints out your top ten tracks you've listened to on Spotify (medium range of time, whatever that means, lol), and your top ten artists. 

### Dependancies
Spotipy - for the spotify integration
MusixMatch - for the lyrics
